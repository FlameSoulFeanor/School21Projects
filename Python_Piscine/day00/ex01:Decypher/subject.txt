Exercise 01: Decypher

This time inspector was a lot more calm, even a bit cheerful. In the crime lab
they've figured out that the blockchain implementation used by criminals was
really poorly designed, so even in these circumstances they've managed to pull
some documents out of the distributed network.
But then one incoming SMS changed everything.

— Sherlock! They want to blow up several buildings in London! Today!
Inspector jumped up from the armchair and started nerviously walking back and
forth.

— Give me more.

— One of the documents had a list of locations and directions. At first we
thought that it is a list of their meeting points, but then one operative
found a hidden smartphone on one of those locations. It had instructions
for the engineers for setting up the device, but no exact locations. Only
a whole bunch of very weird emails.

— Can I see?

— Sure.

This WAS weird. Emails consisted of some strange texts, like "The only way
everyone reaches Brenda rapidly is delivering groceries explicitly" or
"Britain is Great because everyone necessitates".

After about two minutes of silently looking at those emails, Sherlock
grabbed his laptop again and started furiously typing. In next minute, he
turned it around and showed the list to Lestrade.

— I think these are the locations where bombs will be planted. The
algorithm is actually pretty simple.

Could you find out how Sherlock figured it out and write a Python script
that can be used to decrypt any messages like that? (If you want to solve
this mystery yourself - don't peek at the checklist right away). It should
be launchable like this:

~$ python decipher.py "Have you delivered eggplant pizza at restored keep?"

and print out the answer as a single word without spaces.
