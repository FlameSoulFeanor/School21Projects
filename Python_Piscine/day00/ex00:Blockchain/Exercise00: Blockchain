Exercise00: Blockchain

So, right now we don't know much about this blockchain's implementation, all we
have is a file with some lines line shown above. But you may have already noticed
a pattern - some lines are starting with several zeroes. So, let's write a Python
script which will be able to receive a text file to its standard input, and then
print out only those lines that start with exactly 5 zeroes.

Keep in mind that the data has been corrupted, so you have to be very careful.
That means, only lines that fit into certain criteria are considered valid:

Correct lines are 32 characters long

They start with exactly 5 zeroes, so e.g. line starting with 6 zeroes is NOT
considered correct

So, for the example above your script should print:

00000254b208c0f43409d8dc00439896
0000085a34260d1c84e89865c210ceb4
0000071f49cffeaea4184be3d507086v

Your code should accept the number of lines as an argument, like this:

~$ cat data_hashes_10lines.txt | python blocks.py 10

This way the program when stop when it processed 10 lines.
